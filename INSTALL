Installing dpic:

   On a Unix-lide system, type `make' to compile the sources, which are
   C99 compatible and should compile and load on most systems. With MinGW,
   you may have to type `./configure' and then `make' to add a library
   to the linking step in order to load the random routines.  On older
   machines you may have to check the settings at the top of the Makefile.
   Type
    `make install' or `sudo make install'
   as necessary, to install the executable in /usr/bin, a man page
   in /usr/share/man/man1,
   and dpic-doc.pdf in /usr/share/dpic.  Typing
    `make PREFIX=local install'
   puts the files in /usr/local instead of /usr.
   To install the executable only, type
    `make installdpic'
   and to install the documents only, type
    `make installdocs'.
   To compile in safe mode, with debug enabled, or with MinGW, DJGPP,
   or other non-Linux compiler, refer to the top of the Makefile.

Web-server installation:

   You probably should disable the sh and copy commands in dpic for
   security reasons.  Uncomment the SAFEMODE definition in Makefile
   or type `make SAFEMODE=-DSAFE_MODE'.  If you do not do this, the -z
   command-line option has the same effect (see below).

Otherwise, commands equivalent to the following should do the trick:
      gcc   -O  -c  main.c
      gcc   -O  -c  -o parser.o dpic.tab.c
      gcc   -O  -c  backend.c
      gcc -o dpic main.o parser.o backend.o -lm
