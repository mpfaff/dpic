Dpic is an implementation of the pic "little language" for creating line
drawings and illustrations for documents, web pages, and other uses.

This file applies to versions of dpic later than June 15, 2019, which contain

Installation:
   See the INSTALL file.

Dpic usage:

   dpic [option] infile > outfile
or 
   cat infile | dpic [option] > outfile 

Options:
   (none)    LaTeX picture output (limited font-based drawing capability)
   -d        basic PDF output, no automatic string formatting
   -e        pict2e output
   -f        Postscript output, strings in psfrag format 
   -g        TikZ-pgf output
   -h        write this message and quit
   -m        mfpic output (see mfpic documentation)
   -p        PSTricks output (see PSTricks documentation)
   -r        raw Postscript output, no automatic string formatting
   -s        MetaPost output (for compatibility)
   -t        eepicemu output (slightly less limited than LaTeX output)
   -v        svg output
   -x        xfig 3.2 output (for wysiwyg drawing)
   -z        safe mode (sh and copy disabled)

Testing:
   Test the installation by typing

     dpic -p quick.pic > quick.tex
     or
     dpic -g quick.pic > quick.tex
     (if you want to test the TikZ-pgf output)

   which produces the input for the following test LaTeX file:

      \documentclass{article}
      \usepackage{pstricks} % or \usepackage{tikz}
      \begin{document}

      \begin{figure}[hbt]
         \begin{center}
         \input quick
         \caption{Customized caption for the figure}
         \end{center}
         \label{Symbolic label}
      \end{figure}
      \end{document}

You can also do the tests in the doc/examples directory.

Bugs:
   If you discover a bug, please check that your version is the latest.
   Feel free to send bug reports.  Dpic has been relatively solid but,
   by definition, it hasn't been tested for all possible illegal input,
   and the distribution has undergone changes for portability, simplicity,
   and to distribute the source as C code.

   When inconsistencies between dpic and gpic are found, I usually check
   to see whether dpic should be changed to conform but there are small
   deliberate differences.  Error and warning messages are not identical.
   Other exceptions can be found in the file dpic-doc.pdf.

Version:
   The version of dpic is the date the source was created, printed as a
   comment in dpic output.
