Dpic is an implementation of the pic "little language" for creating line
drawings and illustrations for documents, web pages, and other uses.

Unix installation:
   Type `./configure' to generate a Makefile, then `make' to compile the
   sources.  Type `make install' or, if necessary, `sudo make install' to
   install the executable in /usr/bin, a man page in /usr/share/man/man1,
   and dpic-doc.pdf in /usr/share/dpic.  Typing `make PREFIX=local install'
   puts the files in /usr/local instead of /usr.  To install the executable
   only, type `make installdpic' and to install the documents only, type
   `make installdocs'.

   The configure script attempts to identify whether specific compiler
   options are required to process C but not all compilers have identical
   options or libraries so you may have to change the Makefile by hand
   accordingly.  You might also look at the file Makefile.default, and
   use it instead.

Web-server installation:
   You probably should disable the sh and copy commands in dpic for security
   reasons.  Uncomment the SAFEMODE definition in Makefile or invoke
   ./configure above as ./configure --enable-safemode.
   If you do not do this, the -z command-line option has the same effect
   (see below).

Installation on a non-unix PC:
   If you do not wish to compile the program, copy dpic.exe from the
   distribution Windows directory into your folder of executable files.
   Note that this version will search for files using PC format for the
   file path; that is, with backslash separators.

   Otherwise, commands equivalent to the following should do the trick:
      gcc   -O  -c  dpic.c
      gcc   -O  -c  p2clib.c
      gcc -o dpic dpic.o p2clib.o -lm


Dpic usage:

   dpic [option] infile > outfile
or 
   cat infile | dpic [option] > outfile 

Options:
   (none)    LaTeX picture output (limited font-based drawing capability)
   -d        basic PDF output, no automatic string formatting
   -e        pict2e output
   -f        Postscript output, strings in psfrag format 
   -g        TikZ-pgf output
   -h        write this message and quit
   -m        mfpic output (see mfpic documentation)
   -p        PSTricks output (see PSTricks documentation)
   -r        raw Postscript output, no automatic string formatting
   -s        MetaPost output (for compatibility)
   -t        eepicemu output (slightly less limited than LaTeX output)
   -v        svg output
   -x        xfig 3.2 output (for wysiwyg drawing)
   -z        safe mode (sh and copy disabled)

Testing:
   Test the installation by typing

     dpic -p quick.pic > quick.tex
     or
     dpic -g quick.pic > quick.tex
     (if you want to test the TikZ-pgf output)

   which produces the input for the following test LaTeX file:

      \documentclass{article}
      \usepackage{pstricks} % or \usepackage{tikz}
      \begin{document}

      \begin{figure}[hbt]
         \begin{center}
         \input quick
         \caption{Customized caption for the figure}
         \end{center}
         \label{Symbolic label}
      \end{figure}
      \end{document}

You can also do the tests in the examples directory (see below for
the distribution directory structure).

           |-doc------
           |
           |-examples-|-sources-
           |          
 dpic-DATE-|          |-Pgen----|-src--
           |          |
           |-src------|-p2c-----|-src--
                      |
                      |-pascal--|-test-
                      |-tables--

Typing "make" in the pascal directory converts the proto-pascal in
the src directory to pascal that is compatible either with GNU pascal
(gpc) or with Free Pascal (fpc) and compiles the source, placing the
executable and the required tables in the pascal/test directory.

Bugs:
   If you discover a bug, please check that your version is the latest.
   Feel free to send bug reports.  Dpic has been relatively solid but,
   by definition, it hasn't been tested for all possible illegal input,
   and the distribution has undergone changes for portability, simplicity,
   and to include the pascal source.  The distributed version is tested
   using pascal compilers and gcc on cygwin32 and cygwin64 machines.

   When inconsistencies between dpic and gpic are found, I usually check
   to see whether dpic should be changed to conform but there are small
   deliberate differences.  Error and warning messages are not identical.
   Other exceptions can be found in the file dpic-doc.pdf.

Version:
   The version of dpic is the date the source was created, printed as a
   comment in dpic output.

Source:
   The source code was originally written and maintained in Pascal to
   run on IBM VM/CMS and DEC VMS operating systems, but it has been
   moved several times over the years and has evolved considerably.
   The Pascal is translated to C by P2C, then changed to simplify
   reading and compilation and to run on a variety of platforms.
   Proto-Pascal source files are included here in the src directory.
   Selected lines are uncommented automatically for translation to C or
   for Pascal compilation.  GNU pascal and Free Pascal are supported
   currently.  A parser generator such as the ubiquitous yacc was not
   readily available when dpic was first written so a different tool
   was employed and has been retained for its good error messaging and
   recovery. If source files in the src directory are changed, the
   Makefile compiles, as necessary, the pascal to C translator and
   the parser generator with its output filters and runs them to produce
   new files in the formats requred.  These tools are included here for
   the sole purpose of generating dpic C source.
