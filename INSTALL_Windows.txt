Installation on a non-unix PC:
   If you do not wish to compile the program, copy dpic.exe from the
   Windows directory at https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~aplevich/dpic
   into your folder of executable files.

   Note that this version will search for files using PC format for the
   file path; that is, with backslash separators.
