In recent years there have been few changes to dpic except for
the occasional bug fix.  More recently, changes have been as
follows:

2009 10 30 Tweaked Makefiles for easier Linux installation. Give an error
  message on attempt to set scale parameter to 0.
2009 10 21 Skip white space preceding pic macro arguments to avoid long
  lines of arguments; e.g. macro( a, <newline> b ) is equivalent to macro(a,b )
2009 07 13 Skip newline after ":" to conform with gpic (see 2008 10 29).
2009 07 09 Added line "shade" for Postscript output, to fill arbitrary polygons.
2009 06 12 Consistent arrowhead on multisegment linear objects.
2009 06 03 More obscure grammar tweaks.
2009 05 29 Slightly streamlined grammar; bugfix for nested x<A,B> constructs.
2009 05 19 Allow "shade" attribute for linear objects with output in PSTricks,
  MPost, and PGF format.  Bugfix for arrowhead.
2009 04 04 Slight change to error message for unknown character.
2009 01 16 Bugfix for continued lines ending in CR LF (PC text) in macros.
2009 01 07 Require filename to contain at least one visible character.
2009 01 04 Redirection added to the print command to allow
  print arg > "filename" or print arg >> "filename" (except in safe mode).
2008 11 20 Fixed some typos in dpic_man.txt
2008 10 29 arrowhead = 0 implemented.
2008 10 29 Previously the line A: <newline> was permitted, and was equivalent to
  A: Here but this has been disallowed to conform to other pic processors.
2008 10 29 More detailed syntax error messages.
