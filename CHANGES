2019 06 20 This is a major clone of the previous distribution, which
           contained compilable C code together with the original pascal
           source.  The pascal was translated to C code using p2c,
           which was included, and parsing was automated by a custom
           compiler-compiler which was also provided.  The current
           package includes C source only with parsing automated using
           GNU bison.  The original lexical analyser has been kept. To
           avoid introducing bugs, the C code has been changed only to
           accommodate bison; some p2c idiosyncrasies remain. The result
           is functionally identical to the previous version for correct
           input.

           A configure file (only needed for MinGW) added.
