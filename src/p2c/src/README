This directory contains the source for "p2c", a Pascal to C translator,
1993 version (with Debian patches), which was distributed under the
GNU license, at least for a time.

Some fixes have been made to the p2c source (marked with DA in the code)
in order to get error-free valgrind results. Compiler options also had to
be tweaked for recent versions of gcc.  Translating the dpic source is a
significant test of p2c but no warranty of correctness should be assumed.
The translator is included here for the sole purpose of creating dpic.c
from the proto-pascal source files.
