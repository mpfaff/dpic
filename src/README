This directory contains the source and supporting files for dpic.
Selected lines in the pascal are uncommented by the Makefiles for
translation to C or for Pascal compilation.  GNU pascal and Free
Pascal are supported currently.  The context-free grammar for dpic is in
dpic.bnf.  A parser generator such as the ubiquitous yacc was not readily
available when dpic was first written so a different tool was employed.
If any source file is changed, the Makefile compiles, as necessary, the
pascal to C translator and the parser generator with its output filters
and runs them to produce new files in the formats requred.  Typing "make
clean" in the directory containing this one and then "make veryclean"
here restores the files of the distribution.
