Typing "make" in this directory compiles the pascal dpic source and
installs it, together with the table file, in the test directory.

Two pascal compilers are currently supported, GNU pascal and Free Pascal,
but the corresponding lines in the Makefile must be uncommented as necessary.

If the compiler is Free Pascal, compiled parse and lexical tables are used.

If the make process fails, use Makefile.default as the Makefile.

Debug has been enabled in the pascal source.  Invoking dpic as, for example,
dpic -1 -p file.pic > file.tex
produces (rather cryptic) debug information in the file "dpic.log", and changing
the option -1 to -2 or higher adds verbosity.

Typing 'make DEBUG= ' compiles with debug disabled.
