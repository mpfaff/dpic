The file Examples.txt contains a minimal example of each of the
different output modes of dpic.  In each case, the input file, LaTeX
file, and processing commands are given.

In a Unix-like environment, the modes can be tested by typing one of
make
make epic
make pstricks
make pgf
make pdf
make mfpic
make psfrag
make postscript
make rawpdf
make svg
make overlay
make pdfoverlay
make metapost
make xfig

... or, you can type 'make all' and stand well back.

Perhaps overlay and pdfoverlay require explanation.  In each case, the
labels are overlaid on a diagram that has been input first.  In
this way, pic graphics or labels can overlay essentially any graphic.

You can also try
make man
which will produce about 15 pages of diagrams from various pic manuals
and other tests.

Typing
make clean
deletes unneeded files created in one of the above steps.
