The file Examples.txt contains a minimal example of each of the
different output modes of dpic.  In each case, the input file, LaTeX
file, and processing commands are given.

In a Unix-like environment, the modes can be tested by typing one of
make
make epic
make pstricks
make pgf
make pdf
make mfpic
make psfrag
make postscript
make overlay
make rawpdf
make pdfoverlay
make metapost
make xfig
make svg

... or, you can type 'make all' and stand well back.

Typing
make clean
deletes unneeded files.
